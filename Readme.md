# Advent of code 2023

Python solutions to Advent of Code 2023.

## Day 1

For part a, iterate over the line forwards and backwards until the first integer is found.
For part b, first reverse the line and the spelled words to efficiently iterate backwards.

## Day 2
Iterate over the lines. For part a, use a function to check each line so we can return early if the check fails.

## Day 3
For part a, iterate over the symbols, add each adjacent number to the total,
and then replace its digits with `.` to avoid double-counting. 
For part b, for each `*` symbol, make a list of all the numbers adjacent to it,  and calculate gear ratio when there are 
only 2. It is not necessary to replace numbers with `.` in this case.
