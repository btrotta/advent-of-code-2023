Python solutions to Advent of Code 2023.

## Day 1

For part a, iterate over the line forwards and backwards until the first integer is found.
For part b, first reverse the line and the spelled words to efficiently iterate backwards.

## Day 2
Iterate over the lines. For part a, use a function to check each line so we can return early if the check fails.
